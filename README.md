# Lucerne ðŸ“¡

**Lucerne** (named after the Swiss city) is a Twitter client designed to amplify my personal Twitter [workflows](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/), written in [Ink](https://dotink.co/).

## Development

Lucerne uses GNU Make for development scripts.

- `make` or `make run` starts an auto-restarting development server that restarts when any relevant files are changed.
- `make fmt` or `make f` auto-formats all Ink files with [inkfmt](https://github.com/thesephist/inkfmt). You need to have inkfmt installed on the system for this to work.

## Unfinished tasks

- [ ] Basic ability to send tweets
- [ ] Reordering channels
- [ ] Fans
